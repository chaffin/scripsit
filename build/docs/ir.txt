# INCIDENT RESPONSE

IR-2 Incident Response Training
-------------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span> provides incident response training to information system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:  

a. Within <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.ir2a);</script></span> of assuming an incident response role or responsibility;

b. When required by information system changes; and

c. <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.ir2c);</script></span> thereafter.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Incident response training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the information system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle/remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification and reporting of suspicious activities, both from external and internal sources. 

**Related controls** 

: AT-3, CP-3, IR-8.

IR-4 Incident Handling
----------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:  

a. Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

b. Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and

c. Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.

**Supplemental Guidance:** 

: Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function). 

**Related controls** 

: [AU-6], [CM-6], CP-2, CP-4, [IR-2], IR-3, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, [SC-7], [SI-3], [SI-4], SI-7.

IR-5 Incident Monitoring
------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span> tracks and documents information system security incidents.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Documenting information system security incidents includes, for example, maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, incident reports, incident response teams, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports. 

**Related controls** 

: [AU-6], IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, [SC-7], [SI-3], [SI-4], SI-7.

IR-6 Incident Reporting
-----------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:

a. Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability within <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.ir6a);</script></span>; and

b. Reports security incident information to <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.ir6b);</script></span>.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal agencies and their subordinate organizations. Suspected security incidents include, for example, the receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Current federal policy requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted from such requirements) report security incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident Handling.
