AT-1 Security Awareness and Training Policy and Procedures
----------------------------------------------------------

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></mark>

a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to <mark><script>document.write(ssp.at1a);</script></mark>:

  1. A security awareness and training policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and

  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security awareness and training policy and associated security awareness and training controls; and

b. Reviews and updates the current:

  1. Security awareness and training policy <mark><script>document.write(ssp.at1b1);</script></mark>; and

  2. Security awareness and training procedures <mark><script>document.write(ssp.at1b2);</script></mark>.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AT family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

: PM-9


AT-2 Security Awareness Training 
--------------------------------

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></mark> provides basic security awareness training to information system users (including managers, senior executives, and contractors):  

a. As part of initial training for new users;

b. When required by information system changes; and

c. <mark><script>document.write(ssp.at2c);</script></mark> thereafter.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Organizations determine the appropriate content of security awareness training and security awareness techniques based on the specific organizational requirements and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. The content includes a basic understanding of the need for information security and user actions to maintain security and to respond to suspected security incidents. The content also addresses awareness of the need for operations security. Security awareness techniques can include, for example, displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security reminders, generating email advisories/notices from senior organizational officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting information security awareness events. 

**Related controls** 

: AT-3, AT-4, PL-4.


AT-2(2) Insider Threat
----------------------

The organization includes security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

** Supplemental Guidance**

: Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can include behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction, attempts to gain access to information not required for job performance, unexplained access to financial resources, bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees, workplace violence, and other serious violations of organizational policies, procedures, directives, rules, or practices. Security awareness training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational policies and procedures.
