# MEDIA PROTECTION 

MP-4 Media Storage
------------------

**Control** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:

a. Physically controls and securely stores <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.mp4a1);</script></span> within <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.mp4a2);</script></span>; and

b. Protects information system media until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Physically controlling information system media includes, for example, conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored media. Secure storage includes, for example, a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a controlled media library.<br /><br />The type of media storage is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information residing on the media. Controlled areas are areas for which organizations provide sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information systems. For media containing information determined by organizations to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel, fewer safeguards may be needed. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate protection.

MP-6 Media Sanitization 
-----------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:

a. Sanitizes <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.mp6a1);</script></span> prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.mp6a2);</script></span> in accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and policies; and

b. Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the security category or classification of the information.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: This control applies to all information system media, both digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal.<br /><br />Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media containing classified information.
