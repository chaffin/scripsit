# PHYSICAL and ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

PE-2 Physical Access Authorizations 
-----------------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:

a. Develops, approves, and maintains a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility where the information system resides;

b. Issues authorization credentials for facility access;

c. Reviews the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe2c);</script></span>; and

d. Removes individuals from the facility access list when access is no longer required.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Authorization credentials include, for example, badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials needed (including level of forge-proof badges, smart cards, or identification cards) consistent with federal standards, policies, and procedures. This control only applies to areas within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible.

PE-3 Physical Access Control
----------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:

a. Enforces physical access authorizations at <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe3a);</script></span> by;

  1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and

  2. Controlling ingress/egress to the facility using <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe3a2);</script></span>;

b. Maintains physical access audit logs for <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe3b);</script></span>;

c. Provides <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe3c);</script></span> to control access to areas within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible;

d. Escorts visitors and monitors visitor activity <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe3d);</script></span>;

e. Secures keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;

f. Inventories <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe3f1);</script></span> every <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe3f2);</script></span>; and

g. Changes combinations and keys <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.pe3g);</script></span> and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or individuals are transferred or terminated.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Organizations determine the types of facility guards needed including, for example, professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or information system users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras, monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system components in secured areas. Physical access control systems comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management Program provides implementation guidance for identity, credential, and access management capabilities for physical access control systems. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to information systems and/or components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of organizational information systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be located in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access to such devices.

PE-5 Access Control for Output Devices
--------------------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span> controls physical access to information system output devices to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Controlling physical access to output devices includes, for example, placing output devices in locked rooms or other secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only, and placing output devices in locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Monitors, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of information system output devices.
