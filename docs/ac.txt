# ACCESS CONTROLS

[AC-2 Account Management] [ac-2.md]
-----------------------

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark>:

a. Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac2.a.control);</script></mark>;  

b. Assigns account managers for information system accounts;  

c. Establishes conditions for group and role membership;  

d. Specifies [authorized users] [id-1] of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;  

e. Requires approvals by <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac2.e.control);</script></mark> for requests to create information system accounts;  

f. Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac2.f.control);</script></mark>;  

g. Monitors the use of information system accounts;

h. Notifies account managers:  

  1. When accounts are no longer required;  
  2. When users are terminated or transferred; and  
  3. When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;  
  
i. Authorizes access to the information system based on:  

  1. A valid access authorization;  
  2. Intended system usage; and  
  3. Other attributes as required by <mark><script>document.write(org.dba);</script></mark> or associated missions/business functions;  
  
j. Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac2.j.control);</script></mark>; and  

k. Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.  

**Supplemental Guidance** 
: <p>Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the [security plan]. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access.</p><p>Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.</p><p>Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.</p>

# [AC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT] [ac-3.md] 

**Control:** The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, control matrices, cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, domains) in information systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information system level and recognizing that information systems can host many applications and services in support of organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security.

**Related controls** 

: [AC-2], [AC-4], AC-5, [AC-6], AC-16, [AC-17], [AC-18], [AC-19], [AC-20], AC-21, [AC-22], [AU-9], CM-5, [CM-6], CM-11, MA-3, [MA-4], [MA-5], [PE-3].


[AC-3(4) Access Enforcement] [ac-34.md]
--------------------------

**DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL**

The information system enforces <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac34);</script></mark> over defined subjects and objects where the policy specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information can do one or more of the following:  

(a) Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;  

(b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;  

(c) Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or the information system's components;  

(d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or  

(e) Change the rules governing access control.  

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with [AC-3] (3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by [AC-3] (3) is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3 (3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, [AC-3] (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.  


AC-4 Information Flow
---------------------

**Control:** The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac4);</script></mark>.  

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.  <br />Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.

: [AC-3], [AC-17], [AC-19], AC-21, [CM-6], [CM-7], SA-8, [SC-2], SC-5, [SC-7], SC-18.


AC-6 Least Privilege
--------------------

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark> employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems. 

**Related controls** 

: [AC-2](access_control.html#ac-2-account-management), [AC-3], AC-5, [CM-6], [CM-7], PL-2.


AC-7 Unsuccessful Logon Attempts
--------------------------------

**Control:** The information system:  

a. Enforces a limit of <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac7a1);</script></mark> consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac7a2);</script></mark>; and  

b. Automatically <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac7b);</script></mark> when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by information systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time period established by organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at both the operating system and the application levels. 

**Related controls** 

: [AC-2], AC-9, AC-14, [IA-5].


# AC-11 SESSION LOCK

**Control:** The information system:  

a. Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac11a);</script></mark> of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user; and

b. Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of information systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined. This is typically at the operating system level, but can also be at the application level. Session locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of information systems, for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays. 

**Related control** 

: [AC-7].


AC-11(1) Session Lock
---------------------

**PATTERN-HIDING DISPLAYS**

The information system conceals, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, for example, patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank screen, with the additional caveat that none of the images convey sensitive information.

# AC-17 REMOTE ACCESS

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark>:

a. Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and

b. Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in [AC-3]. 

**Related controls** 

: [AC-2], [AC-3], [AC-18], [AC-19], [AC-20], CA-3, CA-7, [CM-8], [IA-2], IA-3, IA-8, [MA-4], PE-17, PL-4, SC-10, [SI-4].


AC-17(2) Remote Access
----------------------

**PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY / INTEGRITY USING ENCRYPTION**

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information. 

**Related controls**

: [SC-8], SC-12, [SC-13].


# AC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS 

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark>:  

a. Establishes usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for wireless access; and

b. Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.
Supplemental Guidance: Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication. 

**Related controls** 

: [AC-2], [AC-3], [AC-17], [AC-19], CA-3, CA-7, [CM-8], [IA-2], IA-3, IA-8, PL-4, [SI-4].


AC-18(1) Wireless Access
------------------------

**AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION**

The information system protects wireless access to the system using authentication of <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac181);</script></mark> and encryption.

**Supplemental Guidance**

: None 

**Related controls** 

: [SC-8], [SC-13].


AC-19 Access Control for Mobile Devices
---------------------------------------

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark>:

a. Establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices; and

b. Authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information systems.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls. [AC-20] addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled. 

**Related controls** 

: [AC-3], [AC-7], [AC-18], [AC-20], CA-9, [CM-2], [IA-2], IA-3, MP-2, [MP-4], MP-5, PL-4, [SC-7], SC-43, [SI-3], [SI-4].


# AC-20 USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark> establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to:

a. Access the information system from external information systems; and

b. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information systems.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: External information systems are information systems or components of information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems include, for example: (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational information systems. 

: For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.

: This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information systems; and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems. 

**Related controls** 

: [AC-3], [AC-17], [AC-19], CA-3, PL-4, SA-9.


AC-20(1) Use of External Information Systems
--------------------------------------------

**LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE**

<mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark> permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only when <mark><script>document.write(org.dba);</script></mark>:

(a) Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system as specified in <mark><script>document.write(org.dba);</script></mark>'s information security policy and [security plan] [AC-17]; or

(b) Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external information system.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational information systems. In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external information systems contain the necessary security safeguards (i.e., security controls), so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational information systems. Verification that the required security controls have been implemented can be achieved, for example, by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations. 

**Related control** 

: CA-2.


AC-20(2) Use of External Information Systems
--------------------------------------------

**PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES**

<mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark> <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac202);</script></mark> the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized individuals on external information systems.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external information systems include, for example, complete prohibition of the use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices may be used.


AC-22 Publicly Accessible Content
---------------------------------

**Control:** <mark><script>document.write(org.name);</script></mark>:  

a. Designates [individuals authorized][ac-22-doc] to post information onto a publicly accessible information system;

b. Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information;

c. Reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible information system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and

d. Reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information <mark><script>document.write(ssp.ac22d);</script></mark> and removes such information, if discovered.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and/or guidance, the general public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information). This control addresses information systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the general public, typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-organization information systems is covered by organizational policy.
