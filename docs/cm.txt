# Configuration Management

CM-2 Baseline Configuration 
---------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span> develops, documents, and maintains under configuration control, a current baseline configuration of the information system.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems and system components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of specifications for information systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline configurations include information about information system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change over time. Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.

CM-6 Configuration Settings 
---------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:

a. Establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products employed within the information system using <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.cm6a);</script></span> that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements;

b. Implements the configuration settings;

c. Identifies, documents, and approves any deviations from established configuration settings for <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.cm6c1);</script></span> based on <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.cm6c2);</script></span>; and

d. Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. <br />Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration requirements for federal information systems.

CM-7 Least Functionality 
------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:

a. Configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities; and

b. Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, and/or services: <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.cm7b);</script></span>.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.

CM-8 Information System Component Inventory 
-------------------------------------------

**Control:** <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(cdc.name);</script></span>:  

a. Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that:

  1. Accurately reflects the current information system;
  2. Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system;
  3. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and
  4. Includes <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.cm8a4);</script></span>; and

b. Reviews and updates the information system component inventory <span id="highlight"><script>document.write(ssp.cm8b);</script></span>.

**Supplemental Guidance** 

: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association, information system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of information system components includes, for example, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include, for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location.
