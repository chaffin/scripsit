      "subject": "Cell phone threat",
      "body": "Cell phones can be compromised by malicious software/Apps; through browser attacks/malicious weblinks; via wifi, cell, or Bluetooth connections to malicious hosts; vulnerabilities in the phone such as Near Field Connection (NFC); or through secure message service (SMS)/text message.  Threats are multiplying against smart phones and compromises are getting hard to identify.  Its best to focus on a good defense so I have attached two good reference docs for you to use. In addition, I recommend always using a cell VPN when connecting to public hotspots.  These VPNs are normally very inexpensive.<p>However, here are a few red flags to look for:</p><p>1. Short battery life.  Any tracking functions due to a compromise have to use lots of battery and will often drain the battery faster than normal. Look for sudden changes in batter life.</p><p>2. Excess data use.  Data theft and tracking will also use lots of data so look for spikes in data use.  A great defense is to keep the \"Cellular Data\" function off if not being used.</p><p> 3. Changes in phone settings.  Various compromises will change setting in the phone.  Know your settings and routinely look for any changes.  One great tip is to use the security function in the phone to lock down the settings (location services/ cell data etc.) requiring a password to access and change.</p>"
